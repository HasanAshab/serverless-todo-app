## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](infra/static/images/architecture.png)

### Serverless Architecture Components

#### 🎨 **Frontend Tier**
- **Technology**: React SPA with modern JavaScript
- **Hosting**: Amazon S3 static website hosting
- **CDN**: CloudFront for global content delivery with caching optimization
- **Security**: Origin Access Control (OAC) for secure S3 access
- **Performance**: Optimized cache behaviors for static assets

#### ⚙️ **Backend Tier (Serverless)**
- **API Gateway**: HTTP API for RESTful endpoints with CORS support
- **Lambda Functions**: Individual functions for each CRUD operation
  - `GET /todos` - List all todos
  - `POST /todos` - Create new todo
  - `GET /todos/{id}` - Get specific todo
  - `PUT /todos/{id}` - Update todo
  - `DELETE /todos/{id}` - Delete todo
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules (.mjs)
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on request volume
- **Security**: IAM roles with least privilege access to DynamoDB

#### 🗄️ **Data Tier (NoSQL)**
- **Database**: Amazon DynamoDB with pay-per-request billing
- **Schema**: Simple key-value store with `id` as hash key
- **Performance**: Single-digit millisecond latency
- **Scaling**: Automatic scaling with no capacity planning
- **Security**: IAM-based access control from Lambda functions

### CI/CD Pipeline
* **Frontend**:
  Automated deployment pipeline that uploads build artifacts to S3 (requires manual approval) on successful push to the main branch from `/src/frontend`. The React application is built, optimized, and deployed to S3, then distributed globally via CloudFront CDN. Requires manual approval for production deployment.

* **Backend**:
  Automated deployment pipeline that packages and deploys Lambda functions via Terraform (requires manual approval) on every successful push to the main branch from `/src/backend`. Uses rolling updates with Lambda versioning and automatic rollback capabilities.
